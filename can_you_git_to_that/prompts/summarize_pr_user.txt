The following blocks of text, separated by two dashes (--) and are descriptions of 
edits on files in a code repo for a single pull request.  Read all the separate blocks,
but provide a very simple and very brief overview summary for ALL the edits PUT TOGETHER,
and create a single, easy to understand, very high-level summary.  
DO NOT SUMMARIZE EACH SEPARATE CHANGE IN A NUMBERED BULLET LIST, SUMMARIZE ALL AT ONCE. 
Do not use any technical terms and jargon.
Keep it very general and brief, summarizing all edits in one paragraph, 
and make sure it's suitable for non-technical readers as an 
executive summary.  Provide ONLY a single, simple paragraph as a response. 
DO NOT RESPOND WITH A LIST.
