This is a JSON of the types of work, where "tag" is the name of
the type of work, and "total value" is the relatively value 
that captures how often this type of work has been performed 
in this repo, over the lifetime of the repo itself.  This 
data should be useful in projecting the nature of this repo 
and it's constituent services/product-purpose/domain, etc.

Mark important phrases or key points, as one would with a highlighter on paper, 
by enclosing it within || before, and || after.  Example: There are 
||killer bees in the building|| and the catering has arrived in the kitchen.
