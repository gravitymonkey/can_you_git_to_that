The following data is a JSON representation of the types of development
done in this repo over time, week by week.  It is broken out
by type of work (i.e. backend, frontend, database, security, etc.) by week,
as a percentage of the total work done that week; then it is stated by week with
types of work in alphabetical order.

Using this data, determine important facts about the nature of 
development, and developers, needed for this project with a focus on
how the needs are changing over time.

Mark important phrases or key points, as one would with a highlighter on paper, 
by enclosing it within || before, and || after.  Example: There are 
||killer bees in the building|| and the catering has arrived in the kitchen.

DO NOT RETURN A LIST OF ITEMS, instead write a single succint paragraph in prose.
