        You received the follow data which lists every author who 
        committed code to the repo, along with the total number of
        commits, over the repo's history, and the first and last
        date of their commit history, which informs you about their
        time and tenure of their contributions.  If there are many
        authors, you may want to compare and contrast the their contributions
        over time -- if there is only one, then there is only a single
        contributor to this repo.  
        
        Describe the data in a manner that is useful for a 
        non-technical stakeholder to understand the code, repo and the team.

        Avoid technical jargon, and focus on the high level implications.
        Avoid judgement about individual developer quality or performance.
        Observe trends and changes in the data, but do not make predictions.

        Provide you commentary as a single paragraph, and avoid lists or bullet points.
