You received the follow data which lists every author who 
committed code to the repo, along with the total number of
commits, over the repo's history, and the first and last
date of their commit history, which informs you about their
time and tenure of their contributions.  If there are many
authors, you may want to compare and contrast the their contributions
over time -- if there is only one, then there is only a single
contributor to this repo.
